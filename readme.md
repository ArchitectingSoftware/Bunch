# Bunch

This is a project that I built as part of my Ph.D. research in Computer Science at [Drexel University](http://drexel.edu/cci/). 

The project has been recently updated to use Maven as the build system, and to take advantage of JDK/JRE 8 optimizers.

The code was actively developed from 1998-2001, and has been lightly patched since then.  Its a goal of mine to update the code base to modern Java standards, and even reimplment part of the code in Scala.
  
More information on the Bunch tool and my research into software clustering can be found on my [webpage](https://www.cs.drexel.edu/~bmitchell/new/#/research)

I'd welcome pull requests if you would like to contribute towards modernizing the codebase.
